      <h2>
        Hi, welcome to my page!
      </h2>

      <h2>
        I'm a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience working mainly in the mobile sphere. Before that, I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Statistics.
      </h2>

      <h2>
        When I was a teenager, I watched the movie The Social Network. This movie instilled in me the drive to become a developer and create really cool products. Right now, I'm working at Capital One on their customer-facing Android and iOS apps helping people around the world manage their credit card transactions. Over the course of my career, I hope to touch many areas of technology and contribute to some amazing projects. Outside of my career, I love coffee, baseball, and Formula 1.
